# The-Download-Handler
This script which I wrote during my time at Wood Mackenzie as a Data Analyst, is written for the sole purpose of aiding the analysts in their data analysis. The script automatically handles the time consuming task(s) of going to different webpages, copying and selecting data and then saving them to various folders on the network. This version which has been adapted for use outwith of the company largely fulfills the download routine but has no access to company drives. It is meant purely as a demonstration of some specific libraries and modules in Python which interact with websites. These modules are namely: Selenium web driver, Requests, BeautifulSoup4 and scrapy (which I don't actually use in this script version). Naturally many other modules are employed in tandem with the aforementioned modules to achieve the desired objective: OS module, Win32com, Pythoncom and Shutil.
